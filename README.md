# MSRG
A living document listing as many modular synthesis resources as possible. Community driven; submissions welcome!

The actual Modular Synthesis Resource Guide is published [here](https://josheikenberry.github.io/MSRG/) . This is the github repo that houses the actual guide and helps generate the page with a theme.

Submissions, corrections, and suggestions are all welcome. Feel free to fork and do a pull request, or if you'd rather not fuss around with Git, you can submit suggestions directly to me, josheikenberry [AT] gmail [DOT] com. Please mention the MSRG somewhere in the subject line so I don't miss it.
